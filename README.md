This is a small javascript application to get the full length of a YouTube playlist.  
  
## How to use:
- Open the playlist page in your web browser (the URL should look something like: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID).
- Open the developer tools inside the browser (in most cases you can right-click and then choose the 'inspect' option, use Ctrl+Shifr+I shortcut or press F12).
- Open the console tab in the developer tools.
- Copy and paste the code from the app.js file into the browser console.
- Full length of the whole playlist will automatically be calculated and logged into the console as a string.  
  
This project is influenced by the following GitHub gist, with more improvements like adding the days feature and fixing the list variable selection bug:
